What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?
I was able reproduce all the code in lecture, and made 6 tweets and 3 users.

What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?
It was cool to make a flask app and view the users in the app, using the browser.

What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?
Encountering bugs were minor issues. Also, just in general getting used flask, the syntax, and understanding the HTML and the different steps
Aaron performed in lecture.
